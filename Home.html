    <h3 class="Details">I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Communication Technology at Taveta Technical and Vocational College. This course has provided me with a solid foundation in programming, networking, systems analysis, and database management. I’ve developed practical skills through hands-on projects and real-world simulations, which have deepened my understanding of how technology is applied in different sectors.
As part of the curriculum, I am preparing for the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) exams, which are essential for evaluating both theoretical knowledge and practical competencies. Studying for KNEC has helped me build strong discipline and a structured approach to learning.
The ICT program has sparked my interest in areas such as Object-Oriented Programming, database design, software development, and web technologies. I enjoy working with code, troubleshooting errors, and discovering better ways to solve technical problems—especially when I get to apply what I learn to real-life challenges.
